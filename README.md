# Ruin-Your-Day

Ruin Your Day is a concept really.  The current iteration of the project is not really what was intended, but more so what I was able to throw together over a 2 day period.  I guess this
first iteration is more an excercise in scope than anything else.  Let's be real though it's a crud app.  Not much going on there if we are being honest. My initial concept was to take an idea and turn it on its head. If you have been on the internet or alive for the last 20 years then you probably like me have been inundated with useless software that sells itself as alleviating some pain point for the user. If we invert this idea then what we will have is an app that creates pain for the user. Pain in this instance is in the form of really, really sad music. Not like pedantic sadness, or teen angst but like real deal not getting out of bed today sadness. 



Enjoy or rather I hope you have a terrible time.

## Wins & Improvements

I had to work with Spotify's API. Suprise!! It's bad. Well ok it isn't intuitive at all but it works, I guess my gripe is with spotify in general. Anyway the win here as mentioned above is scope. It works and it has all the parts and it does represent an idea that I can communicate clearly and I think reflects a deeper part of me through an otherwise really un creative thing like making a CRUDDY application.
